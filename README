For Us Presidents to reproduce AUPR score presented in the paper:
	1. Run: party_membership.py file.
	2. By default the code runs with the boundary condition.
	3. The data used for this experiments is in Dataset Folder and the name is us-presidents.rdf
	4. To run other algorithms for example harmonic 
	disable line containing #P = get_boundary_score(train_nodes,labs,Tc,orig_ids)
	and enable P = get_harmonic_score(train_nodes,labs)
